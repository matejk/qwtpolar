Introduction
============

QwtPolar uses qmake to build all its components and examples.
qmake is part of a Qt distribution.

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro".
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

qwtpolar.pri is read by all project files of the QwtPolar package.
So the first step is to read and edit qwtpolar.pri to adjust it to your
needs. 

QwtPolar 0.0.x needs Qwt 5.1.x. In qwtpolar.pri you need to
insert the paths to your Qwt installation.

Good luck !
