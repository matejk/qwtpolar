Introduction
============

QwtPolar uses qmake to build all its components and examples.
qmake is part of a Qt distribution.

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro".
Files that end with the suffix "*.pri" are included by the project
files and contain definitions, that are common for several project files.

qwtpolar.pri is read by all project files of the QwtPolar package.
So the first step is to read and edit qwtpolar.pri to adjust it to your
needs. 

QwtPolar 1.x needs a proper installation of Qwt 6.x. For building 
QwtPolar you need to configure qmake to find the installed Qwt features
file qwt.prf. Read http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qmake-advanced-usage.html#adding-new-configuration-features.

The subdirs template of qmake is known to be buggy when using spaces
in path names. So better don't build Qwt below a path name with spaces.
( Otherwise you might have to run qmake in all subdirs manually ).


Documentation
==========================

Qwt includes a class documentation, that is available in various formats:

- Html files
- Qt Compressed Help (*.qch ) for the Qt assistant.
- Man pages ( UNIX only )

Building QwtPolar
==========================

The easiest way to build QwtPolar is from the command line - but you insist on
using an IDE don't forget the "make install" step.

qmake
make 
make install

Using Qwt
===========

For building a Qwt application with qmake use the Qwt configuration features
file, that has been installed by "make install". When qmake is able to find
it ( http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qmake-advanced-usage.html#adding-new-configuration-features )
you can simply add "CONFIG += qwt qwtpolar" to your application project file.

Good luck !
